 * What a new donation may be given as — on the public Wakaf & Infaq form and
 * when staff record one.
 *
 * Zakat is not among them. Only BAZNAS, a licensed LAZ or a UPZ that BAZNAS
 * forms may collect zakat (UU 23/2011 Pasal 38 and 41), and the yayasan's own
 * site offers wakaf, scholarships and infaq but no zakat. The user's rule of
 * 2026-09-27: offer what the yayasan itself offers, until its zakat status is
 * known (`.claude/memory/decisions/istilah-dan-penamaan.md` §7). The types stay
 * in Prisma's `PublicDonationType`, so donations recorded before still read and
 * filter by their type.
