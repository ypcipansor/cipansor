/**
 * The SPMB announcement on the public site: a banner, and a dialog that appears
 * a few seconds into a visit — once a visit, until the visitor closes it for
 * the intake (the X, Escape, or the call to action). "Later" closes it for the
 * visit only.
 *
 * What it says is derived from the units' intakes (`findPublicIntakes`), the
 * same source the SPMB page and the chatbot read, so they cannot disagree. It
 * is never typed by hand, so it cannot outlive the intake it announces the way
 * the old hardcoded "SPMB 2026 Telah Dibuka" badge did — a badge the hero used
 * to carry until this announcement replaced it (the banner says the same thing,
 * so the badge was removed rather than repeated).
 *
 * The shape follows the standards, deliberately:
 * - Google Search Central says to "use banners instead of interstitials" and
 *   counts only overlays that obstruct content as intrusive. The banner is the
 *   primary surface; the dialog is small, appears after a delay, gives two ways
 *   out, and never blocks the pages it would interrupt most (`/public/spmb`,
 *   the verification pages — those do not mount this at all).
 * - The dialog is **non-modal** (`modal={false}`): Radix renders no overlay and
 *   the page under it stays readable and clickable, so it is a notice rather
 *   than an interstitial. It keeps `role="dialog"` with a labelled title and
 *   description and a visible, labelled close; a non-modal dialog deliberately
 *   does not trap focus or steal it on open.
 * - Both are trilingual (`config/announcement.i18n.ts`); the dialog's close
 *   button carries its own localized label rather than the built-in English
 *   `sr-only` "Close".
 *
 * `enabled` is the host gate, decided by the server that mounts it: the public
 * site (and staging, and `pnpm dev`) show it, the staff portal does not.
