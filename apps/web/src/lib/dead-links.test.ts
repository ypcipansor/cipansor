 * links inside page bodies — buttons, table row actions, breadcrumbs — and
 * those had drifted badly: a Playwright sweep found dead links on most
 * modules, including ones the sidebar never touches. Next prefetches `<Link>`
 * targets, so a dead href costs a 404 round trip on every render of the page
 * that contains it, not only when someone clicks.
 *
 * The KNOWN_MISSING list below is a backlog, not an exemption: each entry is a
 * page that is linked but was never built. Delete entries as the pages land.
 * Anything NOT on the list fails this test, which is the point — the set can
 * shrink but must never grow.
