/**
 * Which host serves which pages.
 *
 * The public site and the information system now live on separate hosts:
 *
 *   cipansor.or.id         — landing, profil, unit, berita, galeri, wakaf, kontak, verifikasi
 *   portal.cipansor.or.id  — login and everything behind it
 *
 * The split is enforced here rather than in nginx because the route table lives
 * in this codebase; nginx would have to be edited every time a page is added,
 * and the copy that drifts is the one that causes the outage.
 *
 * WHY SPLIT AT ALL. Whether a page is public is decided by `publicPrefixes` in
 * middleware.ts — a list maintained by hand. A page added under a new prefix
 * that nobody remembers to list bounces a prospective parent to the staff login
 * screen, which is what got the Ad Grants application rejected once already.
 * Serving the marketing site from a host that has no application on it makes
 * "public" the default there instead of something to remember.
 *
 * A CONSEQUENCE WORTH KNOWING. Sessions do not cross hosts: the token lives in
 * localStorage (per-origin) and the `auth-storage` cookie is host-only, with no
 * `domain=` attribute. So after the split the apex effectively only ever sees
 * signed-out visitors, and the portal holds the whole session. That is the
 * intended shape, and it is also why per-unit subdomains were rejected — a
 * bendahara holding roles in two units would have had to sign in twice.

 * Whether this host should ship the PWA — manifest, service worker, install

 *
 * One build serves both hosts, so anything in the root layout's `<head>` is
 * emitted on the marketing site too unless it is asked to stop. Before this,
 * the apex advertised itself as an installable app: `<link rel="manifest">` on
 * every page, `/sw.js` registered on first visit, and a floating "Pasang
 * aplikasi Cipansor" banner shown to prospective parents reading /profil.
 *
 * Three reasons that is wrong, in order of how much they cost:
 *
 *  1. What gets installed is the brochure. `start_url` is "/", which on the
 *     apex is the landing page, and all three manifest `shortcuts` — /dashboard,
 *     /attendance, /students — answer 404 there. The visitor installs an icon
 *     that opens a website and a menu of three dead links.
 *  2. Sessions do not cross hosts (see the note at the top of this file), so an
 *     app installed from the apex could never sign anyone in even if the routes
 *     existed. The application is at portal.cipansor.or.id; that is the only
 *     origin where an installed app means anything.
 *  3. sw.js intercepts navigations and serves static assets cache-first. On the
 *     marketing site — the one Google's reviewers actually visit — that puts a
 *     cache in front of the pages whose freshness we are being judged on.
 *
 * NOTE THE POLARITY. This is "off on the public site", not "on for the portal".
 * `isPublicSiteHost` is deliberately false for localhost and previews, so the
 * PWA keeps working in `pnpm dev` and anywhere else; only the two marketing
 * names turn it off. Written the other way round, every developer would lose
 * the ability to test the install flow locally.
