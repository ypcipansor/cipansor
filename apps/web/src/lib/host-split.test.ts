 *
 * Adding a page to one and not the other fails quietly and in opposite
 * directions: miss host-split and the page is served only from
 * portal.cipansor.or.id behind a login; miss middleware and the apex serves it
 * and then bounces the visitor to a login screen that host cannot satisfy.
 * Either way an anonymous visitor — a prospective parent, or the Ad Grants
 * reviewer — meets a sign-in form on a marketing page.
 *
 * Parsed out of middleware.ts rather than imported, matching rbac.test.ts:
 * the list is a module-private const, and duplicating it here to compare
 * against would defeat the entire point of comparing.
