/**
 * How an e-mail actually leaves the building.
 *
 * Three transports, chosen in this order by what is configured:
 *
 *   1. `gmail_api` — a Google Cloud service account with domain-wide
 *      delegation, impersonating the sending mailbox and calling
 *      `gmail.users.messages.send`. **Preferred.** There is no password: the
 *      credential is an RSA key scoped to `gmail.send` alone, revocable from the
 *      Admin console, and useless for reading mail or signing in.
 *   2. `smtp` — smtp.gmail.com with an app password or OAuth2. Kept as a
 *      fallback because it needs no Cloud project, but an app password is a
 *      bearer credential that grants the whole mailbox.
 *   3. `log` — nothing is sent. What an unconfigured deployment does.
 *
 * WHY THIS IS A SEPARATE FILE. The old code decided "can we send?" inline in
 * `sendEmail`, and the answer was invisible everywhere else: with SMTP_HOST
 * unset it logged the mail, returned `{ success: true }`, and the settings
 * screen went on reporting "Channel Email Aktif". Nobody could tell a delivered
 * e-mail from a discarded one. `describeEmailTransport()` now answers that
 * question for the API, the logs and the UI from one place, and
 * `deliverEmail()` reports `delivered: false` rather than pretending.

/**
 * Rough plain-text alternative for an HTML mail.
 *
 * Not a full converter and not trying to be. A message with no text/plain part
 * scores worse with spam filters and is unreadable in text-only clients, and
 * every template here is a table of labelled facts, so dropping the tags and
 * collapsing whitespace gives a usable fallback.
 *
 * Markup is stripped BEFORE entities are decoded, and nothing strips tags
 * afterwards. That ordering is the whole point:
 *
 *   - Real `<script>`/`<style>`/tags are removed while still markup, so they
 *     can never survive into the result. Decoding first would turn an escaped
 *     `&lt;script&gt;` into a `<script>` the tag regex is then expected to
 *     remove — an inherently incomplete second pass that leaves an injection
 *     aperture.
 *   - Entities are decoded once, on a string that is already markup-free, so
 *     `&lt;code&gt;` becomes the literal text `<code>` rather than being
 *     mistaken for a tag and deleted.
 *
 * A single tag-strip pass over `<<script>script>` leaves `<script>` behind,
 * because the inner tag is consumed and the two halves join into a new one.
 * Re-applying the pass to a fixed point closes that hole, but a fixed-point
 * loop is not free: a tag split across many layers (closing an inner `</style>`
 * re-fuses an outer `<sty…` into `<style`) peels one layer per round, so O(n)
 * rounds of an O(n) scan is quadratic. Both strip passes below build the same
 * fixed point in a single left-to-right stack scan instead, which is O(n).
 *
 * The destructive passes are NOT independent, so applying them one after the
 * other is not enough. Removing a `<head>` fragment can fuse `<sty` with a
 * later `le>` into a fresh `<style>` opener, and vice versa; if the `style` pass
 * has already run, that new element is never processed and its contents leak
 * into the plain-text body (`<sty<head>h</head>le>css</style>` -> `css`). The
 * two element patterns are therefore stripped by a SINGLE interleaved scan
 * (`stripHiddenElements`) that reaches the joint fixed point of both passes at
 * once, rather than a local fixed point per pass. The generic tag strip that
 * follows cannot re-introduce `<` or `>` — it only deletes — so no later pass
 * can re-open the hole the element scan just closed.
 *
 * HTML comments are handled by the SAME joint scan, not by a separate
 * pre-pass. A comment body may contain `<` and `>`, so the generic tag strip
 * below — which bounds a run at the next `>` — cannot tell
 * `<!-- note > hidden -->` from a tag and would stop at the first `>` and leak
 * the rest of the comment (code scanning alert 27's class). A separate
 * `comment-strip` pass would itself be vulnerable to the same fusion this
 * function exists to close: deleting a comment can glue a stray `<!-` and a
 * `-` into a fresh `<!--`, and deleting a `<style>`/`<head>` element can glue
 * a comment's own `<!--` back together, so the newly formed comment (with a
 * `>` in its body) would survive every later pass. Folding the pattern into
 * the joint scan lets a fusion re-fire in the same pass, so the fixed point is
 * reached without rescanning.
 *
 * Every pass is a hand-written left-to-right scan, not a regex: a `<...>` body
 * is bounded by the next `<`, and each character is visited a constant number
 * of times. The `<style>`/`<head>` and generic patterns used to be regexes that
 * backtracked quadratically on input such as `<a` repeated (code scanning
 * alert 49's class), so the whole function is linear in the input length.
 *
 * The result is plain text, NOT HTML-safe markup. A decoded entity can produce
 * a literal `<script>` in the output (e.g. from `&lt;script&gt;`), which is
 * inert only while the consumer does not re-embed it as HTML without escaping.

/**
 * Remove `<style>`/`<head>` elements (contents included) and HTML comments to

 *
 * The passes are not independent. A `</head>` removal can fuse an earlier
 * `<sty` with a later `le>` into a fresh `<style` opener, and a `</style>`
 * removal can do the mirror image for `head`; a sequential
 * `stripElement(x,'style')` then `stripElement(x,'head')` leaves that freshly
 * formed element — and the text it hides — in the output. Comments fuse the
 * same way: deleting a `<style>` element can glue a comment's own `<!--` back
 * together, and deleting a comment can glue a stray `<!-` and `-` into a fresh
 * `<!--`. A comment processed by a separate pass would carry its body's `>`
 * past every later pass.
 *
 * One scan sees every such fusion as it happens, because it only ever looks at
 * the *current tail* of the growing output. Detection and deletion are each
 * pattern's own greedy rule:
 *
 *   - An opener is tracked by that pattern's earliest still-unmatched position.
 *     For `style`/`head` the opener is the literal `<name` (no `>` needed); for
 *     comments it is the full `<!--`, since the terminator is `-->` and the
 *     body must not be split on `>`.
 *   - When a close arrives while its pattern has an unmatched opener, delete
 *     from that earliest opener through the close. Every opener at or after it
 *     — of ANY pattern, since all sit inside the deleted span — is retired
 *     too. Because each pattern's earliest unmatched opener is always the one
 *     that would fire next, this is exactly what re-applying the three passes
 *     to a shared fixed point would do, but without rescanning: a character is
 *     appended once and dropped at most once, so the scan is O(n).
 *
 * This is order-independent by construction: the earliest pending opener across
 * the live tail determines each truncation regardless of which pass you imagine
 * running. A `style`/`head` opener with no close is left for the generic tag
 * strip, and input stutters near an already-deleted prefix (detection is
 * tail-based, deletion is global) are normalised by that strip, which cannot
 * re-create `<` or `>`.
 *
 * A tail match alone does not make an opener real: `<!--` (and `<style`/`<head`)
 * can appear *as text* inside a quoted attribute value — `<a title="<!--">` —
 * where it opens nothing, and a `>` inside such a value ends no tag. The
 * scanner therefore consults `quotedAttributeMask` and refuses an opener whose
 * `<` is masked, and refuses a `>` that is masked as a close. Treating the
 * masked `<!--` as a real comment made the unclosed-comment rule below truncate
 * the whole output at the attribute, deleting the visible `link</a>…` that
 * followed (code scanning alert 27 regression). A masked `<` is copied through
 * untouched; the mask is computed from the raw input up front so a fusion later
 * in the scan can never move a boundary.
 *
 * A comment opener that is still pending when the input ends has no `-->`, so
 * per HTML's comment parsing rule it runs to end-of-input: everything from
 * `<!--` onward is dropped. This applies only to a `<!--` that the mask does
 * NOT consider attribute text; leaving an unmasked one to the generic tag
 * strip instead would bound it at the first `>` and leak the rest of the body,
 * which is the incomplete-sanitization class this scan exists to close.
