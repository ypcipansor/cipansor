/**
 * Google service-account access tokens (JWT-bearer flow).
 *
 * Implements the two steps Google documents for server-to-server auth:
 *
 *   1. sign a JWT assertion with the service account's RSA private key, and
 *   2. exchange it at https://oauth2.googleapis.com/token for an access token.
 *
 * WHY BY HAND, RATHER THAN `google-auth-library`. Everything here is 40 lines
 * of `node:crypto` against a stable, published spec, and it costs the API image
 * nothing. The library would add a dependency tree (gaxios, gtoken, jws,
 * gcp-metadata) to a container that already ships a Prisma engine, for a single
 * RS256 signature we can make with the standard library. Note what this file
 * does NOT do: it never *verifies* a token, so none of the usual hand-rolled-JWT
 * hazards (algorithm confusion, skipped signature checks) apply. It signs an
 * assertion with a key we own and hands it to Google, who does the verifying.
 *
 * `subject` is the domain-wide-delegation part: the service account has no
 * mailbox of its own, so it asks to act *as* a real Workspace user. That
 * impersonation is what the Workspace admin authorises, per scope, in
 * Admin console → Security → API controls → Domain-wide delegation.
