# Container entrypoint for the API image.

# MIGRATE_ON_START=true applies pending Prisma migrations before the API starts.
# It exists for Azure, where the database is on a private network that CI cannot
# reach, so migrations run from inside the container instead. `migrate deploy`
# only applies committed migration files, never generates or resets anything,
# and takes an advisory lock, so a second starting container waits rather than
# racing. If it fails the container exits here and the API never starts against a
# half-migrated schema.
#
# Unset (docker compose on the VM) it is skipped, and releases keep running
# migrations by hand as the deploy runbook describes. The same holds for
# PERSISTENT_DIR below.

# PERSISTENT_DIR (Azure App Service): the api writes files to public/uploads and
# private/identity under its working directory. On the VM those are docker
# volumes. On App Service the only storage that survives a restart and reaches a
# sidecar container is the app's /home (Azure Files mounts reach the main
# container only), so both directories become links into $PERSISTENT_DIR. A
# directory that already holds files is never replaced: that would hide them.
