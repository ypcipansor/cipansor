# Does this change touch code? The one answer CI, E2E and the staging deploy
# share, so a documentation-only change does not spend runner minutes on lint,
# builds, tests, the E2E suite and an image rebuild that cannot come out
# differently.

#   change-scope.sh classify              stdin: paths; stdout: the ones that are code
#   change-scope.sh pr <number>           the pull request's files
#   change-scope.sh since-pass <workflow> push to main: everything since the last
#                                         commit on which <workflow> passed
#   change-scope.sh between <base> <head> two commits (the staging deploy)
#
# The last three write `run=true|false` to $GITHUB_OUTPUT (the key can be
# changed with SCOPE_KEY) and print the reason. Every doubt answers `true`: a
# file list that cannot be read, a list the API may have truncated, history
# that is not a straight line. Skipping a needed run is the expensive mistake.
#
# Why "since the last pass" on main and not "since the previous commit":
# concurrency cancels a run when the next commit lands. If a code commit's run
# is cancelled by a docs-only commit that then compares itself only to its
# parent, the code is never tested. Comparing with the last commit that passed
# covers everything the cancelled run would have. That works by induction,
# because a skipped run only passes when its own change was not code.
#
# POSIX sh on purpose: the unit test runs it inside the gate's Alpine container.
