# Sync a pull request's labels with every issue it closes, and fail when they
# cannot be reconciled.
#
# The PR and each issue it closes must carry the same "shared" labels: the type
# labels (bug, enhancement, documentation, refactor, chore, security) and the
# priority label. Labels that describe an issue's own lifecycle (question,
# needs-info, duplicate, invalid, wontfix, blocked, ready, in-progress, ...) are
# not copied.
#
#   * missing shared labels are added to the PR
#   * a priority on the PR that contradicts the issues is corrected
#   * a genuine disagreement (a different type on the PR, two issues it closes
#     that disagree, an ambiguous issue with two priorities) fails the check for
#     a human or the review automation to resolve
#
# Usage: issue-label-sync.sh <pr-number>
#        issue-label-sync.sh --issue <issue-number>   # re-sync every open PR
#                                                       # that closes the issue
