# Warn on a `duplicate` issue and a `duplicate-pr` pull request, then close the
# item if nothing changes within the grace period. Re-run daily by
# duplicate-sweep.yml.
#
# For each open issue labelled `duplicate` and each open PR labelled
# `duplicate-pr`:
#   * no warning comment yet          -> post the warning, record the timestamp
#   * warning present, still labelled -> if older than GRACE_DAYS, close it
#   * label removed                   -> nothing (the sweep only sees the label)
#
# A PR and an issue are swept the same way; only the label, the noun and the
# `gh` command differ. The label differs (`duplicate` vs `duplicate-pr`) because
# `duplicate` is an issue-lifecycle label that must never sit on a PR, and the
# issue-label-sync workflow fails a PR that carries one (docs/LABELS.md, rule 2).
#
# "Show it is not a duplicate" means the author did something a maintainer can
# weigh: edited the description, or replied to the warning. The sweep holds no
# state between runs: it reads the warning's timestamp back from the marker in
# its own comment, and it detects an edit by comparing the description hash it
# recorded in that comment against the text now. Relying on the item's updatedAt
# is not enough - a later automated comment also bumps it, so an edit made
# before that comment would be invisible.
#
# Usage: duplicate-sweep.sh
# Env:   GH_TOKEN, REPO, GRACE_DAYS (default 7)
